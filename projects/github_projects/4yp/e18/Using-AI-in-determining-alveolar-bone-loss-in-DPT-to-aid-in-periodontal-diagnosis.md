title: Using AI in determining alveolar bone loss in DPT to aid in periodontal diagnosis
permalink: /4yp/e18/Using-AI-in-determining-alveolar-bone-loss-in-DPT-to-aid-in-periodontal-diagnosis/
description: Teeth depend on bone support. Periodontal Disease (PD) arises from bone
  loss, causing tooth loss. Radiographs detect bone loss; PD severity is measured
  by the percentage of lost bone. AI aids precise diagnosis on panoramic radiographs,
  enhancing dental professionals' performance in periodontitis diagnosis and treatment.
