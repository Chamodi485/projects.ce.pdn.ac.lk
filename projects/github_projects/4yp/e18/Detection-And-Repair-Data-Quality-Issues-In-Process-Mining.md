title: Detection And Repair Data Quality Issues In Process Mining
permalink: /4yp/e18/Detection-And-Repair-Data-Quality-Issues-In-Process-Mining/
description: This research project is aimed at developing an algorithm for the detection
  and repair of one or a few of the identified imperfection patterns in process mining
  event logs. Our goal is to create a plugin for Praeclarus, a PDQ (Process Data Quality)
  framework that addresses imperfections, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of
  process analysis.
