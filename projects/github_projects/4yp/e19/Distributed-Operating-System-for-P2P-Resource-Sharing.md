description: A distributed operating system (DOS) tailored for peer-to-peer (P2P)
  devices connected via local network, enabling efficient resource pooling and sharing,
  fault tolerance, and scalability. The proposed DOS will allow devices within a local
  network to share excess computational resources dynamically without disrupting their
  native operations.
