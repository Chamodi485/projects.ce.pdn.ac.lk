permalink: /4yp/e16/Using-Computer-Vision-and-Agent-Based-Modelling-to-Explore-the-Human-Elephant-Conflict/
description: "This project proposes the use of satellite images and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to identify elephant habitats and elephant corridors and their deterioration. Then to apply an Agent Based Modelling to model elephant behavior with relation to decaying forest cover and increasing human development."
