As a solution to increasing traffic congestion and resulting air pollution, many major cities around the world encourage citizens to use bicycles for regular travel. In addition to addressing the main issues mentioned above, bicycle riding allows more health benefits to city dwellers through increased physical activity. We have recognized similar requirements in the Sri Lankan context, not only in cities but also in Universities where thousands of occupants frequently require short to medium-distance travel.

Our team is designing a complete system for automated bicycle sharing at the Department of Computer Engineering, named *PeraRide*, where subscribed users can conveniently borrow and return bikes. The systemâ€™s design is finalized at this stage, and looking for volunteer hardware and software developers to complete the prototype and final integration.
